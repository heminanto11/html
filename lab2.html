		<p>Twitter has started blocking accounts flagged by the Centre for allegedly spreading "misinformation and provocative content" in connection with the protest by farmers' unions against new farm laws. Twitter also said it had taken steps to reduce the visibility of the hashtags containing "harmful content".<p>
			<ol>
				<li>However, the social media firm said in its blog that the Twitter handles would only be blocked within India, and would not include the handles of journalists, media entities, activists and politicians.</li>
				<li>"To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law... We do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law," Twitter said.</li>
				<li>According to a Times of India report, 126 of the 257 handles that had originally tweeted with the "farmer genocide" hashtag have been deactivated. These were among the handles that Twitter had blocked a few days ago but had activated them citing "free speech" and because it found the content "newsworthy".</li>

		<h2 id ="article2">In fresh notice, govt asks Twitter to block 1,178 accounts</h2>
		<p>The development comes days after the <b>IT Ministry sent a fresh list of 1,178 accounts to Twitter, asking it to either suspend or block them in India</b>. The ministry said these accounts "were flagged by security agencies as accounts of Khalistan sympathisers or backed by Pakistan, causing threat to public order by tweeting on ongoing farmers protests".</p>
		<p>The notice further added that Twitter was obliged to follow the government's directions and refusal to do so might invite penal action.</p>
		<p>On Tuesday, Twitter reached out to Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for a dialogue and also acknowledged the MeitY letter.</p>
		<p>In an emailed statement to India Today, Twitter said,<i> "Safety of our employees is a top priority for us at Twitter. We continue to be engaged with the government of India from a position of respect and have reached out to the Honourable Minister, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, for a formal dialogue."</i></p>
		<p>Last week, the company's public policy director for India and South Asia, Mahima Kaul, had resigned, citing "personal reasons".</p>

		<h2 id ="article3">Twitter-Centre tussle since January 31</h2>
		<p>The tussle between Twitter and the Centre started when the IT Ministry sent a list of 257 accounts as part of a notice on January 31, asking the platform to block these handles and some hashtags used by them. Twitter had responded by blocking some of the accounts, but had later unblocked them, irking the ministry. It had said that the blocking of the accounts was an interim measure.</p>
